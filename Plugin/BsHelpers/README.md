The full documentation is available here : http://webandcow.github.io/CakePHP-BsHelpers


## Installation

Ensure require is present in composer.json. This will install the plugin into Plugin/BsHelpers:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"webandcow/bs_helpers": "*"
	}
}
```

### Enable plugin

You need to enable the plugin in your app/Config/bootstrap.php file:

`CakePlugin::load('BsHelpers');`

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();`, then this is not necessary.

Then, add those following lines in your app/Controller/AppController.php file :

```php
class AppController extends Controller {
         public $helpers = array('BsHelpers.Bs', 'BsHelpers.BsForm');
}
```
